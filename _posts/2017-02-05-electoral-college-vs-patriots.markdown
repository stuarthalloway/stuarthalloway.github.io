We all know that Hillary Clinton won the popular vote, and that Donald
Trump won the Electoral College. The Super Bowl can help us put that
disparity into context.

Trump's narrow Electoral College win ranks
[46th of 58][electoral-college-margins] electoral college decisions. Scaled
to match the number of Super Bowls, that is equivalent to
having the 40th best out of 50 Super Bowls. This places Trump between:

* the 2015 Patriots, who defeated the Seahawks by four, and
* the 1971 Colts, who beat the Cowboys by three

Clinton's popular vote win is similarly narrow:
[41st of 49][popular-vote-margins] recorded popular votes. This happens to
place Clinton in the same place as Trump on the Super Bowl list,
i.e. between a three and four point win.

So how big a deal is the Electoral College? It took a three-and-a-half
point win by for Clinton, and turned it into a three-and-a-half point
win for Trump. That is a seven point total swing: the Electoral
College acted a a bonus touchdown for Trump.

What would that kind of imbalance do to a football team? Consider the
New England Patriots. FiveThirtyEight ran the numbers, and concluded
that the Patriots are the [NFL's greatest dynasty][dynasty]. That
sounds pretty formidable. Can the Patriots beat their opponents and
the Electoral College too?

Not a chance. When the Electoral College spots their opponents a Super
Bowl touchdown, the Patriots deflate completely.
Worst. Folders. Evah. They have been to eight Super Bowls, and lost
every one. How sad. No wonder Tom Brady has a [Trump hat][trump-hat].

As Donald Trump says, the Electoral College is a
[disaster for democracy][disaster].
It is high time we [abolish the Electoral College][abolish].
