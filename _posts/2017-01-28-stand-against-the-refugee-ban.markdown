I stand against Donald Trump's [executive order][executive-order] banning refugees. It is
a direct insult, not just to the refugees themselves, but to the
spirit that makes America great.

These refugees are

* People who [helped American soldiers][helped-soldiers].
* People who are [fleeing America's enemies][fleeing-enemies].
* People who are ready to [contribute][contribute] to the American dream.  

Even if the ban were a good idea, the [heavy-handed rush][rush] hurts
America's reputation among our friends and allies around the world.

Congress, do your job.

* Demand that the President operate within the [legal framework][legal-framework] you created.
* Demand that the President make a [clean disclosure][disclosure] of all his business interests.
